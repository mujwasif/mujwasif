## 📌 About Me

I'm a Computer Science graduate from BRAC University with a strong foundation in full-stack development and machine learning. Whether it's scraping thousands of Bengali reviews for sentiment analysis, building web apps from scratch, or fiddling with BERT models — I'm always up for a challenge.

I enjoy learning by doing, and I love building cool, useful things with code. Currently, I’m looking for opportunities to grow and contribute in real-world projects, ideally in a team that values curiosity and clean code.
